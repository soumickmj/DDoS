# DDoS-UNet: Incorporating temporal information using Dynamic Dual-channel UNet for enhancing super-resolution of dynamic MRI
Official code of the paper "DDoS-UNet: Incorporating temporal information using Dynamic Dual-channel UNet for enhancing super-resolution of dynamic MRI" ([10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3427674](https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3427674))

The pre-print of this work is available on ArXiv: https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05355 and the published version is available on IEEE Xplore: https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3427674

Initial version of this work was presented as an abstract at ESMRMB 2021 (Abstract available on RG: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354888919_DDoS_Dynamic_Dual-Channel_U-Net_for_Improving_Deep_Learning_Based_Super-Resolution_of_Abdominal_Dynamic_MRI), and a "spin-off" of this work for radial MRI has been accepted as an abstract for ISMRM-ESMRMB 2022 (Abstract available on RG: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358357562_Motion-robust_dynamic_abdominal_MRI_using_k-t_GRASP_and_dynamic_dual-channel_training_of_super-resolution_U-Net_DDoS-UNet)

The name "DDoS" is inspired by the name of the cyber-attack: distributed denial-of-service attack (DDoS attack), as this project tries to "attack" the problem of super-resolution of dynamic MRI from two aspects: spatial super-resolution and temporal prior incorporation.
